# sphero_sdk

A Flutter SDK for Sphero

A decent portion of this was translated from the [sphero.js](https://github.com/sphero-inc/sphero.js/blob/master/LICENSE) sdk, and [spherov2.js](https://github.com/igbopie/spherov2.js/blob/master/LICENSE) sdk.

No guarantees are given if you use this SDK. Use at your own risk. I've done my best, but only have the Sphero SPKR+ to test on, and even that I haven't tested fully.
